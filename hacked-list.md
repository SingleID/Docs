It’s only a slice of data from 2015, and the company says the leak’s been patched up, but data once stolen can never be controlled: and so 1.1 million names of self-declared Beautiful People will now begin circulating.

The customer’s name;
their mobile telephone number
their bank sort code
the last 4 digits of their bank account

### TalkTalk cyber-attack: Website hit by 'significant' breach

http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34611857

2015-10-22

TalkTalk has confirmed that the amount of data stolen is nowhere near as bad as early reports suggested, but that 1.2 million email addresses, names and phone numbers were taken. Some 21,000 unique bank accounts and sort codes were also accessed, along with 28,000 credit and debit card details with the middle six digits obscured. Around 15,000 dates of birth were also taken.

Some papers reported this weekend that the information was being sold for £1.62 per record on the dark web, although this is largely conjecture.

The hacked ISP, which boasts four million, now angry, customers, has confirmed that it will not let anyone out of their contracts without paying exit fees of anything up to hundreds of pounds, unless they can prove that they have had money stolen as a direct result of the attack.

### Experian Hacked -> T-mobile affected

https://grahamcluley.com/2015/10/experian-hacked-15-million-mobile-customers-risk/

2015-10-02

Hackers have stolen information about 15 million people - all of whom had interacted with T-Mobile either as customers or potential customers.

Innocent users have had personal information such as their name, address, and date of birth exposed to the criminals. In addition, encrypted fields in the hacked databases including "social security number and ID number (such as driver’s license or passport number)" may be at risk.

That's reason enough for T-Mobile CEO John Legere to very angry. But imagine his apoplexy when he realises that the hackers didn't breach T-Mobile's computer systems, but those of Experian, one of the largest data brokers and credit agencies in the world - tasked with credit-checking T-Mobile's users.

2015-05-04 

http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=18342


"At 10:49am PDT on March 24, 2015, an attacker logged into EllisLab.com with a Super Admin’s stolen password. The perpetrator then uploaded a common PHP backdoor script (a WSO Web Shell variant) that allowed a group of attackers access to our server without requiring authentication," EllisLab CEO Derek Jones explained in a blog post on Friday.

"While evidence shows it is unlikely that they stole the database, we prefer to be cautious and assume they had access to everything," he noted. "Everything" includes usernames, screen names, email addresses, salted and hashed passwords, member profile data; billing name, address and last four digits of the credit card customers used to purchase software from the company; and details regarding support tickets submitted between February 24 and March 24, 2015.

The Federal Communications Commission says employees in 2013 and 2014 retrieved customer proprietary network information and other personal data that could be used to unlock AT&T mobile phones.

### Puush accidentally infects Windows users with password-stealing malware

2015-03-30
http://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/puush-accidentally-infects-windows-users-with-password-stealing-malware-11639.html

The main puush web server was compromised (database and puushed files should be untouched, to the best of our knowledge)

The Windows puush client was replaced with a version (r94) that downloads malware (versions other than r94 should be clean).

The malware may be collecting locally stored passwords, but we are yet to confirm these have been transmitted back to a remote location. We have been running the malware in sandboxed environments and have not been able to reproduce any such behaviour. Even so, we recommend you change any important passwords which were stored on your PC (unless they were in a secure password manager). **This includes changing any chrome/firefox/opera/ie/outlook/live messenger/thunderbird saved passwords.**

### RadioShack: Not only data breaches

2015-03-24

http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/despite-privacy-policy-radioshack-customer-data-up-for-sale-in-auction/

Apparently Radio Shack had a policy of not selling customer data. But that was before they went bankrupt and the data went to the auction house.

This is a problem with Chapter 7 in the US. Unless a white knight buys the data to kill it (rare, but it has happened), the  data will be sold to a firm that is not bound by any RS agreement. Thankfully, it's not healthcare data.

### Uber Database Breach Exposed Information Of 50,000 Drivers
2015-02-27

http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/27/uber-database-breach-exposed-information-of-50000-drivers-company-confirms/

---
According to [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/03/in-major-goof-uber-stored-sensitive-database-key-on-public-github-page/), Uber seems to have made the most rookie security mistake of them all, which Dan Goodin calls "the online equivalent of stashing a house key under a doormat." It looks like Uber accidentally stored a secure database key—intended for use only by select employees—on a publicly accessible GitHub page. The access key led to a database where drivers' names and license numbers were stored, and was obviously never intended to be public. Once the company realized its database had been breached in May of last year, it changed the key and took the GitHub page offline.
	
Though Uber hasn't publicly confirmed what was on GitHub or who was responsible, it's implying it by subpoenaing GitHub in an effort to get ahold of the IP address of anyone who might have accessed the GitHub page over seven months in 2014 (which GitHub has already refused to do). [The Register has the subpoena and the details](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/28/uber_subpoenas_github_for_hacker_details/), and points out that even if GitHub hands over that info, it'll be extremely lucky if it leads to anything

2014-09-11

http://blog.freenode.net/2014/09/server-issues-2/

We immediately started an investigation to map the extent of the problem and located similar issues with several other machines and have taken those offline. For now, since network traffic may have been sniffed, we recommend that everyone change their NickServ password as a precaution.
With more than 80,000 customers and 40,000 channels, Freenode, which runs Atheme IRC Services and ircd-seven, is said to be the largest IRC network.

### Global Payments, a major credit card processing company, has reportedly been hacked

http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303816504577313411294908868


Estimates for how many card numbers were lost in the breach range from 50,000 cards all the way up to 10 million, so odds are we won't know for sure how many accounts were really compromised until the dust settles a bit. The Wall Street Journal reports that Global Payments is one of the country's largest processors, and while we know they work closely with New York cab and parking companies, WSJ says they actually have a significant client list and the size of the breach could mushroom. Visa and Mastercard have, for their part, already acknowledged that Global Payments has alerted them to the breach, and stress that their own networks have not been compromised.

WSJ's Colin Barr has details Visa's effort to patch a security breach in which information from 1.5 million credit card accounts was stolen. Payment processor Global Payments was removed by Visa as a result.
